# bandcampscraper_php
A small, crude PHP utility that takes a url for a Bandcamp album or track page and returns a JSON object with all music data on that page. Original purpose of this was to be able to add music from and link back out to a Bandcamp page from a custom player (e.g. the FullwidthAudioPlayer by radykal), much like you can via the SoundCloud API.
